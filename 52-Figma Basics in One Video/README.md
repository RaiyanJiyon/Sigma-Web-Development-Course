Figma is a powerful cloud-based design tool used for creating user interfaces, website designs, mobile app designs, and other digital designs collaboratively. It's known for its ease of use, real-time collaboration features, and robust design capabilities. Here's a basic overview of Figma:

### Features:
- **Vector Editing:** Figma provides a comprehensive set of vector editing tools similar to those found in Adobe Illustrator, allowing you to create and edit shapes, paths, and text.
- **Prototyping:** You can create interactive prototypes by linking frames together, adding transitions, and defining interaction triggers like clicks and hovers.
- **Components and Libraries:** Figma allows you to create reusable components and design systems that can be easily shared and reused across multiple projects. This promotes consistency and efficiency in your design workflow.
- **Real-time Collaboration:** Multiple users can collaborate on the same design file simultaneously, making it easy to work together with teammates, clients, or stakeholders in real time.
- **Version History:** Figma automatically saves version history, allowing you to review and revert to previous versions of your designs if needed.
- **Comments and Feedback:** You can leave comments directly on specific elements of a design, making it easy to provide feedback and collaborate with others.
- **Plugins:** Figma supports a wide range of plugins that extend its functionality, allowing you to integrate with other tools and streamline your design workflow.

### Basic Workflow:
1. **Creating a New File:** To start a new design, you can create a new file from scratch or use one of Figma's built-in templates.
2. **Designing:** Use Figma's tools and features to create your designs, including shapes, text, images, and more. You can organize your designs into frames and layers for better structure.
3. **Prototyping:** Once your designs are ready, you can create interactive prototypes by linking frames together and defining interaction behaviors.
4. **Collaborating:** Share your design files with teammates or clients and collaborate in real time. You can leave comments, receive feedback, and make revisions collaboratively.
5. **Exporting:** Figma allows you to export your designs in various formats, including PNG, JPG, SVG, PDF, and more. You can also export design assets for development.

### Pricing:
Figma offers both free and paid plans. The free plan allows for unlimited designs but limits the number of projects and collaborators. The paid plans offer additional features such as unlimited projects, version history, and more collaborators. There are plans available for individuals, teams, and organizations.
