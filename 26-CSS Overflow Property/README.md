# CSS Overflow Property

The CSS `overflow` property is used to control what happens when content overflows the boundaries of its containing element. It is particularly useful when dealing with elements with fixed dimensions or when handling large amounts of content. Here's an overview of the `overflow` property and its values:

- `visible`: Default value. Content is not clipped, and overflowing content will be rendered outside the element's box.
- `hidden`: Overflowing content is clipped and not displayed. Content outside the element's box will be hidden.
- `scroll`: Content is clipped, but a scrollbar is added to the element, allowing users to scroll to see the content that overflows. Both horizontal and vertical scrollbars are displayed if necessary, regardless of whether the content overflows in that direction.
- `auto`: Similar to scroll, but a scrollbar is only added when the content overflows. If content fits within the element's box, no scrollbar is displayed.
- `overlay`: Content is clipped, and a scrollbar is added only if the content overflows. The scrollbar overlays the content, so it does not affect the layout of the page.
- `inherit`: Inherits the overflow value from the parent element.

Using the `overflow` property, you can control how content is displayed when it exceeds the dimensions of its containing element. This property is commonly used in combination with other CSS properties to create scrollable areas, hide overflow, or handle content dynamically.

Here's an example demonstrating the usage of the `overflow` property:
```css
.container {
    width: 200px;
    height: 100px;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    overflow: auto; /* or hidden, scroll, visible, etc. */
}

In this example, the `.container` element has a fixed width and height. If its content exceeds these dimensions, a scrollbar will be added `(auto)` to allow users to scroll and view the overflow content. You can adjust the overflow value as needed to achieve the desired behavior for your layout.
