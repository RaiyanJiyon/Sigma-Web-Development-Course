# JavaScript Conditionals if, else if, else ladder

In JavaScript, conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. The primary conditional statements are `if`, `else if`, and `else`. Hereâ€™s a detailed look at how each of these works and how they can be combined to form an if-else ladder.

## if Statement
The if statement executes a block of code if a specified condition evaluates to true.

```js
if (condition) {
  // Code to execute if the condition is true
}
```

## else Statement
The else statement executes a block of code if the same condition evaluates to false

```js
if (condition) {
  // Code to execute if the condition is true
} else {
  // Code to execute if the condition is false
}
```

## else if Statement
The else if statement allows you to check multiple conditions. If the first condition is false, it will check the next one, and so on.

```js
if (condition1) {
  // Code to execute if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // Code to execute if condition2 is true
} else {
  // Code to execute if none of the above conditions are true
}
```

### Example of an If-Else Ladder
Hereâ€™s an example that demonstrates the use of if, else if, and else:

```js
let score = 85;

if (score >= 90) {
  console.log("Grade: A");
} else if (score >= 80) {
  console.log("Grade: B");
} else if (score >= 70) {
  console.log("Grade: C");
} else if (score >= 60) {
  console.log("Grade: D");
} else {
  console.log("Grade: F");
}
```

In this example:

- If score is 90 or above, it prints "Grade: A".
- If score is between 80 and 89, it prints "Grade: B".
- If score is between 70 and 79, it prints "Grade: C".
- If score is between 60 and 69, it prints "Grade: D".
- If score is below 60, it prints "Grade: F".


### Tips for Using Conditionals
`Order Matters:` Conditions are evaluated from top to bottom. Once a condition evaluates to true, the corresponding block of code is executed, and the rest of the conditions are ignored.

`Logical Operators:` You can combine multiple conditions using logical operators like && (and), || (or), and ! (not).

`Readability:` For better readability and maintainability, avoid deep nesting of conditions. Instead, consider breaking complex logic into smaller functions.

### Example with Logical Operators

```js
let temperature = 72;

if (temperature > 85) {
  console.log("It's hot outside.");
} else if (temperature > 65 && temperature <= 85) {
  console.log("The weather is nice.");
} else {
  console.log("It's a bit chilly.");
}
```

### Conclusion
Conditional statements in JavaScript are essential for making decisions in your code. By understanding and using if, else if, and else effectively, you can handle various scenarios and create dynamic and responsive applications.
