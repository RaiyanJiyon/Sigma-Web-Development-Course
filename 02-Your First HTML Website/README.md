# Your First HTML Website

Creating your first HTML website is a great way to dive into web development. Here's a simple guide to get you started:

**Set Up Your Environment:**
- You'll need a text editor to write your HTML code. You can use any text editor you're comfortable with, such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Notepad.
- Create a new folder on your computer to store your website files. This folder will be the root directory of your website.

**Create an HTML File:**
1. Open your text editor and create a new file.
2. Save the file with a .html extension, for example, index.html. The name "index" is often used for the homepage of a website.

**Write Your HTML Code:**
1. Open the HTML file in your text editor.
2. Write the basic structure of an HTML document:


```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Your First Website</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first HTML website.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

3. This code defines a basic HTML document with a heading`(<h1>)` and a paragraph `(<p>)`.
Save Your HTML File:
