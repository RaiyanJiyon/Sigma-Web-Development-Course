# SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML

SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and Core Web Vitals are important aspects of web development that can greatly impact the visibility and performance of your website. Here's how you can address them in HTML:

## SEO (Search Engine Optimization):
SEO involves optimizing your website to improve its visibility in search engine results pages (SERPs).
HTML provides several elements and attributes that can enhance your website's SEO.
Key elements include:
- Title Tag (`<title>`): Define a concise and descriptive title for each webpage using the `<title>` tag. This title appears as the clickable link in search engine results.
- Meta Description (`<meta name="description" content="...">`): Provide a brief summary of the webpage's content using the meta description tag. This description often appears below the title in search results.
- Heading Tags (`<h1>` to `<h6>`): Use heading tags to structure your content hierarchically. Search engines use headings to understand the structure and relevance of your content.
- Alt Attribute for Images (`<img alt="...">`): Include descriptive alt attributes for images to improve accessibility and provide context to search engines.
- Semantic HTML: Use semantic HTML elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, etc., to provide meaning and structure to your content.
- Internal and External Links: Link to relevant pages within your website (internal links) and other authoritative websites (external links).
- Valid HTML: Ensure your HTML code is well-formed and follows best practices to avoid issues with indexing by search engines.

## Core Web Vitals:
Core Web Vitals are a set of metrics that measure user experience on websites, focusing on aspects like loading performance, interactivity, and visual stability.
While some Core Web Vitals optimizations require more than just HTML changes (e.g., optimizing images, CSS, JavaScript), there are still HTML-related considerations:
- Page Loading Performance: Optimize your HTML to facilitate fast page loading times. Minimize unnecessary HTML, use efficient markup, and consider lazy-loading techniques for images and other resources.
- Interactivity: Ensure that your HTML structure allows for quick interaction response. Optimize scripts to minimize render-blocking and prioritize critical resources.
- Visual Stability: Structure your HTML to minimize layout shifts, which can disrupt the user experience. Avoid dynamically injecting content that may cause unexpected shifts in page layout.
By incorporating these HTML practices, you can improve both the SEO performance and Core Web Vitals of your website, leading to better visibility in search engines and a more satisfying user experience.
